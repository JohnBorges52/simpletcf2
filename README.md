## Firebase config (local & CI)

This project expects a generated `public/firebase-config.js` at runtime. The file is generated by `scripts/generate-firebase-config.js` and is ignored from git.

Secrets (set these in GitHub Actions as repository secrets):
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN`
- `FIREBASE_PROJECTID`
- `FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET`
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID`
- `FIREBASE_APPID`
- `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENTID`

Local development:
1. Create a `.env` or set env vars locally.
2. Run:

```bash
npm run generate-config
```

This writes `public/firebase-config.js` which the client code reads automatically.

Removing accidentally committed secrets:
- If secrets were committed previously, remove them from your git history (use `git filter-repo` or the BFG repo cleaner), rotate the exposed credentials, and invalidate any tokens.
- For CI (Cloud Build/GitHub Actions) prefer project/secret managers or repository secrets instead of hardcoding values in repo files.
